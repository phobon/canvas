Note taking for healthcare professionals built using a JAMstack

## Stack

Built using my favourite stack to build stuff these days:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for isolated component development as required
- Still deciding on whether to use something like FaunaDB with GraphQL
